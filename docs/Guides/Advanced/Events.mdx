# Events

The terminal exposes a few events you can use in addons

---

## Available events

- `stateChanged`: (newState: "locked" | "attackers" | "defenders" | "neutral") - Fired when the terminal's state changes.
- `pointsChanged`: (newAttackerPoints: number, newDefenderPoints: number) - Fired when the terminal's points change.
- `playerCountChanged`: (newAttackersCount: number, newDefendersCount: number) - Fired when the number of players on the terminal changes.
- `captureProgressChanged`: (newCaptureProgress: number) - Fired when the terminal's capture progress changes.
- `endEvent`: (winner: "attackers" | "defenders" | "draw") - Fired when the terminal's ends.
- `startEvent`: () - Fired at the start of the round.

## Connecting to events

Events are `BindableEvents` and can be connected to using the `:Connect()` method.
```lua
wrapper.terminal.events.startEvent.Event:Connect(function()
	print("The terminal has started!")
end)
```
