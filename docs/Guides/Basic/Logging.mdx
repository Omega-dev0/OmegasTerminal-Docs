# Event logging

The terminal has a built-in logging system that allows you to log events in a website.

Alternatively, you can send the generated data to a custom API endpoint.

## Enabling logging

To prevent abuse, the service requires an **API key** that can be obtained for **free**. To get one, DM `@omega7707` on discord.

### Add the API key to the config

In the configuration file, scroll down and paste the API key in place of `MY_API_KEY`
```lua {2-2}
onlineReportsEnabled = true,
onlineReportingAPIKey = "MY_API_KEY",
onlineReportingPrivateKey = "MY_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

### Generate a private key

Generate a random string [here](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=1&len=32&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new) and paste it as the private key in place of `MY_PRIVATE_KEY`
```lua {3-3}
onlineReportsEnabled = true,
onlineReportingAPIKey = "MY_API_KEY",
onlineReportingPrivateKey = "MY_PRIVATE_KEY"
```
